# News Application
Project 8 of 10 in the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree

This project was to create an application that would search for relevant news articles using the Guardian API provided through their website. This application would query the site using the search string provided on the main page, and return a JSON response that could be parsed through for the attributes of related articles. 

The information from the JSON response would be used to populate the list items of the scrolling list shown on the main screen. If a user were to click on any of the list items, the browser on their phone would be launched to open up the URL containing the article in question.
